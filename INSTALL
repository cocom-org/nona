  If you don't have SPRUT installed, you may need to

touch ird.c ird.h

so the build system doesn't try to regenerate them.

  Run

autoreconf -i
./configure
make


The NONA Makefile
has additional entries in comparison of the top COCOM Makefile.  These
are:

test - testing NONA
TAGS - updating TAGS in current directory for only NONA

Example of NONA specification is files `a29k.nona' (part of a Pascal
cross-compiler for AM29050).
